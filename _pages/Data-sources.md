## In France

These points can be articles, graphs or even videos. Logging into an account is not required to access information.

It also publishes how and by whom datasets were used.

## In the EU

- [European Data News Hub](https://www.ednh.news/fr/)

Through a datajournalism website, the Agence France Presse (AFP), the ANSA (Italian press agency) and the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) share articles (in five languages), graphs, pictures and explanatory videos on topics related to the European Union. Data is free and open, but also reliable.

In the future, EDNH will open to other media outlets and will allow users (citizens) to answer surveys on salient European issues, which will then be translated into readable data.

EDNH is independent and funded by the European Commission.

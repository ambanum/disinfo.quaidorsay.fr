## We aim at reinforcing the democratic antibodies that are present in our societies

We believe that in the fight against disinformation, many actors are already doing their part to prevent fake news and information manipulation from having an impact on our elections and collective decision processes: investigative journalists, fact-checkers, public open data providers, NGOs, OSINT researchers, concerned citizensâ€¦

However, in the current setup, disinformation sources possess a major advantage: they have just a select narratives to boost in order to split our societies apart along their ethnical, philosophical and historical fracture lines; and they certainly have resources to throw at that. On the other side, most of our defenses are atomized, feeling alone in a fight bigger than themselves. Yet, if we unite, we can be much stronger than any other would want us to be, in a shared reality where dissent is expressed through debate and discussion rather than through lies and division.

## We are building the place where those who work towards coherence and authenticity gather

We are documenting their practices and equipping them with the best tools available, with the intention that they will share their results with each other while keeping their independence. We provide them with opportunities to improve and grow, and identify the most effective ways to decrease the impact of disinformation.

Our first deliverable is this wiki containing most of what weâ€™ve learned. This is an open and evolving documentation of tools, actors and practices that you are most welcome to contribute to.

We have also prototyped a [social bot detector](https://sismo.quaidorsay.fr) for Twitter and intend to work with other vendors to unite our efforts behind a single open source project.

Our main focus at the moment is a chat on steroids: a real-time communication channel where all detection, analysis and reaction can happen in a shared fashion with mutualized tools. Youâ€™ll find more about the chatbots we have built [[here | Chatbots]]. If youâ€™re reading this weâ€™d probably like to have you on board.

## NewsGuard Technologies

NewsGuard Technologies has developed a free browser extension, NewsGuard, which rates websites according to their transparency and credibility.

Journalists, editors and analysts at NewsGuard rate and review when possible "_thousands of news and information websites_" based on the repeated publication of false content, the responsibility of the gathering and presentation of information, error correction or clarification, the differentiation between news and opinion, the deceptiveness of headlines, the disclosure of ownership and financing, the clarity of ad labels, the level of information about content supervisors as well as the level of information given about content providers.

NewsGuard classifies websites in either **platforms**, **satires**, **reds** or **greens**.

Platforms are sites that are hard to define according to transparency or credibility criteria. They primarily host non-vetted user-generated content but their reliability is difficult to assess. As to satires, they are not "real news websites" but may have a humoristic purpose, for instance.

Green websites are deemed credible and reliable. Detail about which criteria are filled can be provided by NewsGuard, thus adding nuance.

Red websites simply fail "_to meet basic standards of credibility and transparency_".

Ratings are periodically updated. Before being rated, suspicious websites are directly called by NewsGuard to obtain more information. For each site, a "Nutrition Label" is drafted by analysts. It contains "_the site’s performance on each of the nine criteria and a written explanation of the content on the site, who’s behind it, and why it received its rating_".

## Elves

[Elves](https://desinfo.quaidorsay.fr/encyclopedia/definitions/vocabulary/#elves) is a term born in the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia), which later spread south in eastern and later western Europe. Hunting and fighting trolls, they usually work in self-organized networks to counter disinformation. Their activities include debunking, the spreading of fact-checks, and the finding of fake accounts - among others.

It is difficult to assess the level of influence exerted by their actions. However, especially in the Baltic states and more particularly Lithuania, elves have gained significant media attention in their digital warfare against pro-Kremlin trolls.

## Correct the record

On March 12, 2019, international cyberactivism NGO Avaaz ("voice" in sanskrit) published a report called "Yellow Vests flooded by Fake News - Over 100M views if disinformation on Facebook" in which it called on Facebook to "**Correct the Record**" ahead of EU Elections.
Alongside a study on disinformation - especially Russian campaigns - focused on the Yellow Vests movement in France, Avaaz details its proposal for an innovative solution.

Based on cooperation between factcheckers and platforms (especially Facebook), the initiative works following a [five-step process](https://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AVAAZ_YellowVests_100miofake.pdf.pdf.pdf).
First,  content **viewed by a significant number of people** and deemed false or misleading after **verification by independent fact-checkers** would "activate" an obligation for platforms to correct the record.
Then, platforms woud have to provide a **misinformation report mechanism** that is easy to access for users, as well as access for fact-checkers to content that has been viewed by a significant number of people.
Reported content should then be **fact-checked** within 24 hours by "_independent, third-party, verified factcheckers_" working with the platforms.
Platforms are also asked to display their "_most visible notification standard_" to **notify** all users exposed to verified
disinformation.
Lastly,  "_each user exposed to disinformation should receive a correction that is of at least equal prominence to the original content and that follows best practices_", specifically adapted to the user's profile.

Ultimately, all platforms users exposed to disinformation would receive independent third party corrections. One key-point is the avoidance of the repetition of disinformation.

Through this initiative, Avaaz's goal is to "_restore the public’s trust_" and "_ensure the integrity_" of the upcoming European elections.

## Judiciary

## Denial

Quickly denying one's involvement or responsibility in an event or domain can be a way for an actor to counter the effects of the spread of disinformation. Given that in interference occurrences, disinformation campaigns often aim at weakening or destabilizing powerful and / or state instances, a direct denial reaction can be appropriate.

For instance, in March 2019, several Algerian media outlets (including _observalgerie.com_ and _algeriepatriotique.com_ ) spread the fake news that France was suspending visa delivery for Algerian natives. The French Consulate in Algeria publicly reacted the same day.

It is difficult to assess the efficiency of such denials but direct reactions can help discredit disinformation-spreading outlets, instances and individuals as well as facilitate the work and action of fact-checkers.

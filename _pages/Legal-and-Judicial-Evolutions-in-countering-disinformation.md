## 1. In France: a law against intentional information manipulation

In France, a law against information manipulation and the **intentional** spread of disinformation was officially adopted on November 20, 2018, nine months after its proposal.

It focuses on massive and rapid spreads of disinformation on social media and more widely digital tools, including foreign state-owned media outlets, and was meant to be especially efficient in electoral contexts.

During said times, the law compels platforms to be more transparent by, for instance, reporting sponsored content as well as the name and invested resources of sponsors. The biggest, most used platforms are to have a legal representative in France and publish their algorithms as open data.

"Fake news" are also formally defined in order to allow for judiciary action. This definition includes massive and artificial diffusion, capacity of disturbance (of public peace or elections), and undeniability of the falsehood of the information being spread.

Outside of election times, platforms ought to cooperate, as well as build and implement open measures to fight disinformation.
The French Superior Council of the Audiovisual (CSA) has been given the authority to hinder or interrupt the broadcasting of foreign state-owned (or state-influenced) TV-services in cases where fundamental national interests are at stake.

# Detection practices

## Crowdsourcing

Since disinformation is targeted at individuals, can be micro-targeted, and can be done in a hidden fashion in order to avoid exposure of the manipulation techniques, it may be useful to open “tipping” contact points so that any netizen can report what they she or he has seen.

The usefulness of this crowdsourcing, and most of all its signal-vs-noise ratio, has not been publicly evaluated yet.

For example, in the 2018 USA mid-terms elections, the New York Times [asked its readers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/technology/disinformation-tipsheet.html) for “tips” on disinformation.

<!-- document how many tips they got -->

In the 2019 European elections, [FactCheckEU](https://factcheckeu.info) used a prominent “ask us a question” entry point.

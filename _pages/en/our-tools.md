desc="<p>When fighting disinformation, analyses and fact-checks produced often relay - when they are not based on - <strong>figures to measure the impact of a content</strong> on a given society.</p><p>Among such data can be the number of reactions to said content, the number of comments it yields, or the number of times it has been shared.</p><p>However, this data us usually not <strong>contrasted</strong> nor compared. Rather than focusing on their quantitative aspect, we offer an alternative: to organize data according to a scale of relevance. Thus, in considering the topic of the content instead of how many times it was shared, one reaches a <strong>qualitative scale of reference</strong>.</p>"

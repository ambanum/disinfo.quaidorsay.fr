# Twitter Ads Transparency Center Assessment
{: .no-toc}

Twitter pledges to provide public access to political ads in the ("Ads Transparency Center")[https://ads.twitter.com/transparency].

> we believe that transparency is a core part of who we are. As part of our commitment to be more transparent, we’ve created a place where you can search for advertisers and see the details behind ads. (https://ads.twitter.com/transparency)

This document presents the difficulties and limitations of Twitter's transparency effort concerning political ads.

## Introduction

### Policies for retricted contents

Twitter defines categories of [prohibited content and restricted content](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/introduction-to-twitter-ads/twitter-ads-policies.html). Political content is one such category of restricted content. Twitter distinguished two kinds of political content: "political campaigning" and "issue advertising".

> Twitter permits political advertising which includes political campaigning and issue advertising (https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content.html)

These two categories are subject to different policies.

A political campaigning policy has been enforced from [summer 2018 in the USA](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/Increasing-Transparency-for-Political-Campaigning-Ads-on-Twitter.html) and  policy enforcement for Australia, India, and EU Parliamentary elections began [March 11th 2019](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/political-campaigning-advertising-policy-FAQs.html). [Political campaigning advertising is permitted worldwide except in the following countries: Brazil, Cyprus, France, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal, South Korea, Vietnam](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/global-political-content.html)

Policy enforcement for issue advertising began [October 2018](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/issue-ads-policy-FAQs.html). [Issue advocacy advertising is permitted worldwide except in France where only get-out-the-vote ads are permitted.](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/global-political-content.html)

### Twitter Ads Transparency Center

October 24th, 2017, Twitter announced [the launch of the Ads Transparency Center "in the coming weeks"](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/New-Transparency-For-Ads-on-Twitter.html). The Ads Transparency Center was effectively launched [June 28th, 2018](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/Providing-More-Transparency-Around-Advertising-on-Twitter.html). Initially, it displayed only US federal election campaigning ads and it was [extended to EU, India and Australia in February 2019](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/transparency-political-ads.html).

### Certification process

As part of its political content policies, Twitter requires some advertisers to pass a certification process.

## Limitations

### Scattered policies and documentation

Documentation relevant to Twitter's effort for political ads transparency in Europe, is scattered among numerous pages:
* https://ads.twitter.com/transparency
* https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/introduction-to-twitter-ads/twitter-ads-policies.html
* https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content.html
* https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/global-political-content.html
* https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/eu-political-content.html
* https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/how-to-get-certified.html
* https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/ads-transparency-center-faqs.html
* https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/political-campaigning-advertising-policy-FAQs.html
* https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/issue-ads-policy-FAQs.html

Statements are often duplicated at several places in exact or similar terms. All the pages do not seems to have been updated to reflect the recent extension to the European Union. In particular, it is often unclear if a given statement applies to the US or worldwide and for which level of political campaining (federal and/or state level; national and/or european) and in which cases the certification process in mandatory.

For instance, the [issue ads FAQs](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/issue-ads-policy-FAQs.html) applies worldwide, yet makes several references to the USA.

> Twitter's Political Content Policy includes Issue Advocacy which applies to ads that refer to an election or a clearly identified candidate or ads that advocate for legislative issues of national importance. Note that this policy applies to promoted content related to **federal, state, and local elections**.

> Will the issue ads policy cover other issues in the future? We are continually looking into these issues based on **the U.S. political climate**.

> Does the policy apply to non-federal elections? Yes, all promoted political content will be considered an issue ad with a carveout for **federal political content** that is subject to a more stringent certification process.

Note that we could not find more information about the list of topics that Twitter considers "legislative issues of national importance" subject to the issue advertising policy as such, than:

> Examples of legislative issues of national importance include but are not limited to: climate change, healthcare, immigration, national security, taxes. (https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/global-political-content.html)

### It is unclear when certification is mandatory

Certification requirements are unclear outside the USA. The help page for the certification process https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/how-to-get-certified.html has the title **"How to get certified as a political campaigning advertiser"**, suggesting that its content applies worlwide. However, its source code (including the title displayed in the browser tab) contains many references to the title **"How to get certified as a political campaigning advertiser is the U.S."**.

In this page, we read:

> As part of Twitter's Political Content Policy and our overall commitment to transparency, we require that advertisers promoting political campaigning content go through a certification process. Note that this process only applies to advertising related to:
> * US federal elections
> * US issue advocacy

and immediately after, this contradictory reference to other coutries:

> Note: the certification process for Australia, India, and EU Parliamentary elections is closed.

The same ambiguity is found in the [political content policy help page](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content.html):

> This policy applies to political content which consists of political campaigning and issue advocacy advertising.
> 
> Country-specific policies that require certification:
> 
> * United States
> 
> Advertisers can start the certification process here.
> 
> Note: the certification process for Australia, India, and EU Parliamentary elections is closed.

The [Ads Transparency Center FAQs](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/ads-transparency-center-faqs.html) and the [Issue Ads Policy FAQs](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/issue-ads-policy-FAQs.html) make it clear that certification is mandatory to publish any political ad:

> Political Promoted Tweets
> 
> What information is shown for political advertisers?
> 
> Once an advertiser agrees to the updated Terms of Service from their certified political ads account, the Twitter account will appear in the Ads Transparency Center under the corresponding country's advertiser list. (https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/ads-transparency-center-faqs.html)

> If you are an advertiser that promotes issue ads you need to get certified. (https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/issue-ads-policy-FAQs.html)

which is consitent with an [annoucement made February 19th, 2019](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/transparency-political-ads.html):

> Enforcement of this policy will begin the week commencing March 11th in these countries, after which only certified advertisers will be allowed to run political campaigning ads on our service.

However, these pages state that the obligation only holds for ads related to the European elections and not to national elections and issue advertising:

> Answers below apply to Australia, EU Parliamentary elections, India, and the United States. (https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/political-campaigning-advertising-policy-FAQs.html)

> Political campaigning ads for EU Parliamentary Elections ONLY must meet additional eligibility requirements and apply for certification. (https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/restricted-content-policies/political-content/eu-political-content.html)

### No comprehensive access to political ads

As of June 17th, 2019, the [Ads Transparency Center](https://ads.twitter.com/transparency) consists of:
* a search engine on Twitter's ads (including but not limited to political ads),
* the list of certified advertisers for political campaigning, for the USA, the European Union, Australia and India,
* the list of certified issue advertisers for US issue advertising.

Difficult to access uncertified advertisers

on atc it seems only eu election is searchable (but who knows)

-----

> Currently, only Promoted Tweets appear in the Ads Transparency Center.  We are working to include other ad formats in the future. In addition, only ads from certified accounts per the Political Content Ads Policy are displayed in the ATC. (https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/ads-transparency-center-faqs.html)

BUT https://ads.twitter.com/transparency/Carglass_France

### Not everything

tweets vs promoted tweets vs promoted-only tweets


> Political campaigning ads may only be promoted via the use of Promoted Tweets and In-Stream Video Ads

> Currently, only Promoted Tweets appear in the Ads Transparency Center.

> Video Ads are shown in the ATC. Currently, In-stream Video Ads and other ad formats are not shown in the ATC but we are working to include all ad formats in the future.


### Cannot see in which countries the ads where promoted


### No dumps


### Authorization with temporary token

app comes with bearer token
POST https://api.twitter.com/1.1/guest/activate.json with that bearer token to get guest token

guest token in undocumented : we observed it needs frequent renewal every few dozen requests

### Frequent errors by API

500 {"errors":[{"message":"Internal error","code":131}]}

vendredi 7 juin : impossible to fetch 1129277620116492289 info about targeted audience on second campaign (line_item_targeted_audience) f2ajd

can change at any time

### Poor data integrity


"Promoted Tweets created from the dedicated issue ads account will show in the ATC indefinitely. Promoted Tweets from non-political advertisers will be available for seven days." (issue ads FAQs)


> Promoted Tweets created from the dedicated issue ads account will show in the ATC indefinitely. Promoted Tweets from non-political advertisers will be available for seven days.

> If you are a candidate running for a general election in supported countries you must always use your dedicated political campaigning ads account and all your Promoted Tweets will display a ‘Promoted (political) badge, disclaimer information, and show in the Ads Transprency Center indefinetly.


#### Can be removed by twitter or the advertiser

But in https://ads.twitter.com/transparency

> When you search for an advertiser, you’ll be able to see all Promoted Tweets that are currently running on Twitter, including Promoted-only Tweets, or if a Promoted Tweet was suspended and why.

However:

> Country withheld ads will only appear in countries where the content is allowed.

> If an advertiser deletes a Promoted Tweet or their Twitter @username, their Tweets will no longer show in the ATC.

> If an ad is reported and taken down from Twitter, it will be tombstoned in ATC within approximately 24 hours. If the account was suspended, Tweets will not be shown in the ATC. The same applies to deleted users and Tweets.

> If the @username no longer exists, all associated ads will no longer appear  in the ATC.


#### Removed without reason

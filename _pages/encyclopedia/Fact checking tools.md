### 1. [**InVID**](https://www.invid-project.eu/)

#### By whom ?

InVID is a project co-funded by the European Commission started in January 2016 and achieved in December 2018. 

#### What ? 

It focused on video verification of "eyewitness media", with the goal to develop an innovative verification platform "_to detect emerging stories and assess the reliability of newsworthy video files and content spread via social media_". Indeed, editing softwares and content management tools increasingly allow for the spread of fabricated, manipulated, deceiving videos. Content verification is costly and time-consuming for news outlets.

The InVID platform was built to help "_detect, authenticate and check the reliability and accuracy of newsworthy video files and video content spread via social media_".

It works through a verification application, a mobile application, a visual analytics dashboard as well as a verification plug-in (among others) which offer online services for video fragmentation, reverse image search and annotation, a logo detection tool, a context aggregation and analysis tool as well as a rights management service.

#### What for ? 

InVID allows its users to quickly verify video content and make sure that it is rights-cleared and readily available. It helps avoiding the spread (by mistake) of false information or fakes by media outlets. 

#### For whom ?  

Mainly, InVID is useful for "_broadcasters, news agencies, web pure-players, newspapers and publishers_" because it allows them "_to integrate social media content into their news output without struggling to know if they can trust the material or how they can reach the user to ask permission for re-use_".

#### Additional information

InVID is a follow-up project of RevealEU. WeVerify is a follow-up project of both InVID and RevealEU.


### 2. [**Truly Media**](http://www.truly.media/)

#### By whom ?

Truly Media was co-developed by the [innovation lab](http://ilab.atc.gr/) of the [Athens Technology Center](https://www.atc.gr/) (ATC) as well as [Deutsche Welle Innovation](http://blogs.dw.com/innovation/). With [TruthNest](https://github.com/Ndpnt/desinfo.quaidorsay.fr-wiki/wiki/Social-bots#2-truthnest), it is one of the two main tools of ATC's iLab in fighting disinformation. Truly Media can be considered as a follow-up project of several other research projects linked to the European Commission. It is funded by the Google Digital News Initiative.

#### What ? 

Truly Media is an online collaboration platform working on the verification of digital content on social networks. 
Users can monitor social networks, gather information from various sources, collaborate, use effective verification tools, extract and visualize information, etc. Information and content can be organized in collections and shared quickly among users.

#### What for ? 

Truly Media was created to help with the verification of _"digital (user-generated) content residing in social networks and elsewhere_". 

#### For whom ?  

The main targets of the project are journalists and human rights workers and investigators, _ie_ actors who helped in its design and development.

#### Additional information

On 8 April 2019, Truly Media officially announced its collaboration with the European Science Media Hub (ESMH).

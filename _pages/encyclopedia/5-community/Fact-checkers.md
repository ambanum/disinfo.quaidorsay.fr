### 1. [**EUvsDisinfo**](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/)

#### By whom?

_EU versus Disinformation_ is a campaign of the European External Action Service (EEAS) East Stratcom Task Force launched in March 2015.

#### What?

The campaign is supported by a [website](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/news/) as well as several social media accounts ( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/euvsdisinfo) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/EUvsDisinfo/) ).
EUvsDisinfo focuses on "pro-Kremlin" disinformation campaigns, more precisely "_on key messages carried in the media, which have been identified as providing a partial, distorted or false view or interpretation and spreading key pro-Kremlin messaging_". News are selected based on two criteria: 1) factual falsehood 2) origin and alinement with "_identified pro-Kremlin disinformation messaging_".

Their fact-checking articles are produced, published and shared almost daily and are accessible to all. On the website can be found fact-check and debunk articles, then compiled on a large database of over 5 000 disinformation cases in 18 different languages. Every week since November 2015 is published a [Disinformation Review](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinfo-review/) which comprehends said articles as well as news, analyses, studies and reports.

#### What for?

The aim of the campaign is to "_better forecast, address and respond to pro-Kremlin disinformation_".

#### For whom?

The weekly Disinformation Review and fact-check articles are public and available to all. Moreover, the campaign team "_[briefs] and [trains] EU institutions, Member State governments, journalists and researchers_". Their articles and analyses are "_regularly quoted and used by politicians, governments, state agencies, researchers, think tanks and journalists across Europe and beyond_".

### 2. [**FactCheck EU**](https://factcheckeu.info/fr/)

#### By whom?

FactCheck EU was built on an initiative of International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) members by the French newspaper Libération and the digital design company Datagif.

On the basis of cooperation, it gathers contributions from nineteen European media outlets (such as Le Monde, Newtral, Pagella Politica, Lead Stories and Faktograf) from thirteen countries in the European Union (including France, Germany, Greece, Northern Ireland - and Ireland - Croatia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Denmark and Sweden).

#### What?

FactCheck EU offers a [website](https://t.co/Den4RgBOus) with **fact-check articles**, investigation pieces, and a **Q&A**.

It has a direct **public interface for questions**, to better grasp the needs of the public. Questions answered include topics such as the funding for FactCheck EU, the creation of the website, etc. Indeed, founders explicitely seek to build trust and credibility on the basis of transparency.

The articles are published in theme-oriented **categories** (European elections, refugee "crisis"...) and are all **translated at least in English**. They are translated in other languages when deemed relevant; usually the most relevant languages other than English are Spanish and German.

This choice of translation is made based on criteria such as the level of interest of the partners, the degree of literacy in English in the country of publication and the relevance at the EU level. Also, incendiary  or hate-speech related questions and articles are judged less relevant for translation by the creators of FactCheck EU.

#### What for?

Publishing fact-checks and offering direct answers to the questions of its audience helps FactCheck EU to raise awareness within the civil society (media literacy) as well as providing a reliable, open platform for fact-checkers and media outlets on which to share their information, thereby reaching people throughout the EU and not merely nationally.

#### For whom?

FactCheck EU's website is open to all. Partnerships are conducted with European-based fact-checking media outlets.

#### Additional information

FactCheck EU is partially financed by the Google News Initiative, the Open Society Initiative for Europe (OSIE) and the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). The platform was built thanks to a fact-checking innovation grant of the Poynter Institute.

It offers a platform for these actors to collaborate in the fight against disinformation in real time. It also has an analytic tool driven by several articifial intelligences (AIs) that "_spots and identifies disinformation within 2 minutes from real time_".

### 4. [**RevealEU**](https://revealproject.eu/)

#### By whom?

[REVEAL](https://revealproject.eu/) was one of the first projects of the European Commission dealing with verification of digital content. It started in 2013 and formally ended on 31 December 2016.

#### What?

The REVEAL project aimed at developing tools (technologies) and services (methodologies) helpful for social media analysis, especially content verification. Its missions were to help analyze and organize information, protray it intuitively and provide context all the while protecting personal data. Its consortium produced open publications available on the REVEAL website.

#### What for?

Through REVEAL, EU actors seeked to determine the level of trustworthiness of an information, "_predict contributor impact and how much or to what extent all this affects [hidden modalities such as] reputation or influence_", with the overall goal of a "_better understanding and utilization of the social media world_".

#### For whom?

This project could provide journalists with content, content analysis, tools and services described above. But it also could help companies improving their processes and products through the providing of "_organised, summarised and evaluated_" data.

#### Additional information

REVEAL was funded by the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration.

### 5. [**WeVerify**](https://weverify.eu/)

#### By whom?

[We Verify](https://weverify.eu/) is an EU co-funded horizon 2020 research and innovation project started in December 2018 and planned to end at the end of November 2021.

#### What ?

WeVerify focuses on social network analysis and algorithm-supported verification of digital content.
It will provide analysis of social media and web content to detect disinformation and ultimately expose misleading and fabricated content "_through micro-targeted debunking and a blockchain-based public database of known fakes_".
To do so, it will use machine learning, participatory verification and open source algorithms, among other tools and methods.

WeVerify will also provide an open source platform for "_collaborative, decentralised content verification, tracking, and debunking_" as well as a "_digital companion to assist with verification tasks_", datasets and documentation.

#### What for?

The main goal of the project is "_to address the advanced content verification challenges_".

#### For whom?

Although data and perhaps tools should be open and accessible to all, this project is mainly aimed at journalists.

### 1. [**Les Décodeurs**](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/)

Les Décodeurs is a team of journalists from _Le Monde_ who fact-chek, explain and give context to current news in almost-real time. They rank the news they check from "true" to "false" on a scale that also comprehends "rather true", "questionable", "exaggerated" or "simplistic". They developed a tool, [**Decodex**](https://www.lemonde.fr/verification/), which works as an interface for readers. The user just has to type in the address or the name of a website or a page to know whether the source (_i.e._ the diffuser of the news) is deemed reliable or not.  It also works as a plug-in. Decodex also offers information in a media literacy effort. For instance, one can find on their webpage open questions such as "What is information?" or "How to check that a rumour spreading on social networks is true?" and their detailed answers.

### 2. [**AFP Factuel**](https://factuel.afp.com/)

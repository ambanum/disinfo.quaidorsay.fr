# Other actors fighting disinformation

##### 1. [**In the EU**](https://github.com/Ndpnt/desinfo.quaidorsay.fr-wiki/wiki/Community#in-the-eu)

## In the EU

1. [The Rapid Alert System (RAS)](#1-the-rapid-alert-system-ras)
2. [Lie Detectors](#2-lie-detectors)
3. [EU DisinfoLab](#3-eu-disinfolab)

### 1. **The Rapid Alert System (RAS)**

The EEAS has set up a Rapid Alert System enabling all Member States to share information and notify one another of disinformation campaigns.

#### By whom ?

The Rapid Alert System was officially created in December 2018 as part of the European External Action Service's (EEAS) Action Plan against Disinformation, and was launched in March 2019. Commission services such as DG DIGIT, DG COMM, DG CNECT are active contributors to its building.

#### What ?

The RAS mechanism is based on collaboration.
Through a secure digital platform, EU Member States (as each Member State has an official national contact point) and relevant national representatives or experts can discuss, share information on past and ongoing foreign disinformation campaigns with one another, share useful tools and efficient pratices and ultimately coordinate responses.

Moreover, the RAS allows its members to warn other members of ongoing information manipulation. Today, the main topic at hand are the upcoming European elections, national elections withtin the EU, disinformation campaigns and solutions to be implemented.

The RAS is no security hazard since what is shared through it is crucial yet not sensitive intelligence. European and national security is thus not only preserved, but increased, thanks to the improvement and gain in the level of information and expertise, constituting a solid, lasting basis to better fight disinformation and its consequences.

It is providing immediate and centralized access to various information from reliable, heterogeneous agents, information that would have been rather complex to obtain and classify at a merely national level.

#### What for ?

The main goal of the RAS is to ease and increase the speed of information (trends, reports, analyses, etc.) sharing among relevant actors, thus allowing more efficient and direct communication around common stakes. Ultimately, quicker, more efficient and possibly synchronized responses should emerge.

This tool has many other advantages. For instance, knowledge mutualization is essential to better define and understand disinformation and its outcomes. A better circulation of information flows, combined to a sharing principle, allows for mutual and active learning.

This not only improves the quality of the shared information, it also improves the reaction to this information while decreasing its delay of implementation.

Step by step, the mechanism aims at creating resilience within governments as well as within civil society.

#### For whom ?

The RAS is open to EU Member States as well as relevant european and national representatives or experts. It is destined to help all actors (state or non-state) who actively fight disinformation.

#### Additional information

No classified information is shared on the RAS, which works on the basis of  open source intelligence (OSINT), an information collection and analysis method based on data coming from public, open sources.

Data is stored on a secure, encrypted server and access to RAS domains is limited to its members and requires two-factor authentication.

### 2. [**Lie Detectors**](https://lie-detectors.org/)

#### By whom ?

In 2018 was created the European Commission’s High Level Expert Group on Digital Disinformation and Fake News to advise and offer lasting solutions to online disinformation and find out "_how to tackle the spread and socio-economic impact of disinformation_". [Lie Detectors](https://lie-detectors.org/) is one of its 39 members. It was created by journalist Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck.

#### What ?

Lie Detectors works by offering free, interactive 90-minute classroom sessions by working journalists and media experts, in Europe, to school pupils aged ten to fifteen. "_Sessions include an overview of fake news, methods of testing for misinformation, and analysis of drivers of the fake-news phenomenon_". As a media literacy initiative, goals of the initiative include the education to news media, an increase in the awareness of misinformation and the information and empowerment of students.

#### What for?

The ultimate goal of Lie Detectors is to increase media and news literacy Europe-wide in order to empower people to make free, informed choices.

#### For whom ?

This initiative is addressed to ten to fifteen years old schoolchildren in Europe.

#### Additional information

This project won the 2018 EU Digital skills award of the European Commission.


### 3. [**EU DisinfoLab**](https://www.disinfo.eu/)

#### What ?

The EU DisinfoLab is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) based in Brussels, which _"provides innovation and scientific support to civil society actors fighting disinformation_". It studies and exposes online communities by mapping social media clusters and monitor and source disinformation. Its methodology is based on Social Network Analysis (SNA).

The Lab also publishes studies and organizes conferences to initiate and facilitate collaboration, collaboration and sharing of tools and practices between actors (experts, organisations, etc.) countering disinformation internationally.

It also intents to develop a legal framework "_preserving our freedoms while offering a sustainable solution to the disinformation threat_".

#### What for ?

The broad goal of the NGO is to "_fight disinformation with innovative methodology and scientific support to the counter-disinformation community_" and comprehends raising awareness within the civil society.

#### For whom ?

The NGO's work is transparent and open to all. It especially targets actors and organizations actively fighting disinformation.

### 1. [**Les Décodeurs**](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/)

Les Décodeurs is a team of journalists from _Le Monde_ who fact-chek, explain and give context to current news in almost-real time. They rank the news they check from "true" to "false" on a scale that also comprehends "rather true", "questionable", "exaggerated" or "simplistic". They developed a tool, [**Decodex**](https://www.lemonde.fr/verification/), which works as an interface for readers. The user just has to type in the address or the name of a website or a page to know whether the source (_i.e._ the diffuser of the news) is deemed reliable or not.  It also works as a plug-in. Decodex also offers information in a media literacy effort. For instance, one can find on their webpage open questions such as "What is information?" or "How to check that a rumour spreading on social networks is true?" and their detailed answers.

### 2. [**AFP Factuel**](https://factuel.afp.com/)

This website of the French Press Agency simply provides fact-checks of articles and current news. It is open to everyone.

### 3. [**Vrai Ou Fake**](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/vrai-ou-fake/)

This is a factchecking and debunking platform for all of the French broadcasting audience. It gathers content produced by various media such as Arte, France Médias Monde, France Télévisions, Radio France and TV5 MONDE.

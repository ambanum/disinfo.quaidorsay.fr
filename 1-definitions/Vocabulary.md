# Vocabulary

## Information manipulation

Intentional and massive dissemination of false or biased news for hostile political purposes, including  the weakening or destabilization of democratic debate [(1)](https://ambanum.github.io/disinformation-encyclopedia/definitions/vocabulary/#1).

### Disinformation

Disinformation is a form of information manipulation. It relies on the spread of deliberately false or misleading information with the aim of producing an effect. It is not to be mistaken for misinformation, which is unintentional.

### Fake news

Not necessarily false (actually, it is rarely purely fabricated) but rather falsified, counterfeit, or forged information [(1)](https://ambanum.github.io/disinformation-encyclopedia/definitions/vocabulary/#1).


## Campaign _(disinformation campaign)_

- Content that is demonstrably false or misleading is called a _payload_.
- The massive and artificial spread of that payload is called a _campaign_.
- If that campaign is supported by a foreign actor, it is called _interference_.
- If it is organised by a foreign actor, it is called an _attack_.
- The organic spread of the payload by nationals of the target country (or countries) is called a _success_ of the campaign.

## Fact-checking

Process of verifying the veracity of facts presented as truthful.

## Debunking

## Interference

Exogenous information manipulation orchestrated within a State by foreign State actors.

# Tools to detect and follow trends on social networks

Some actors still consider creating their own detection tools.
While this can lead to innovation, it is most certainly not the fastest way to detect disinformation.

Moreover, these tools entirely depend on access to social networks data - which is not easily  provided - and need regular maintenance to be kept functional.

It constantly assesses their engagements (number of likes, tweets, pins, video views, shares, etc.) and then calculates their current rate of increase per hour.

The so-tracked links are then stored and open to filtered search. Filters comprehend keywords, source, author, domain, date, language and type.
